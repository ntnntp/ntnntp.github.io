               INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - 19:00

               The boy wakes up in a gloomy bedroom. It was already dusk. He
               seems relaxed and still groggy.

               He got up from his bed and walked towards the door, going for
               his late dinner.



               INT. HALLWAY & STAIRS

               The lights outside his room were not turned on; but that did
               not seem to bother him. He continues to walk outside.

               He walks downstairs to the 1st floor, and found out that he
               is at home alone.



               INT. DINING ROOM FL.1

               He slowly enters the dining room.

               A bright note on the fridge caught his attention. The note
               writes "Mommy & daddy will be back by 6 na ka" with tiny
               footnote saying "the food is on the table."

               He turns to the dining table. He saw a fahchee on the table,
               likely covering his meals.

               He walks towards the table, sits down, and opens the fahchee.

               He picks up the spoon, starting to eat, but he paused. He
               feels that something is off. He slowly looks around, sweeping
               his sight from left to right.

               He sees a creepy doll right in front of him. 
                             (Eerie horror music plays)

               He continues to finish his meal anxiously and can't get his
               eyes out of that creepy doll.

               As he looks, the doll looks back...

               And he stares even more...

               And the dolls stares back even harder.



               INT. LIVING ROOM L.1

               The boy sits on the couch. He picks up the remote and turns
               on the TV, hoping it would relieve his fear
                             (The TV is turning on.)

               Suddenly, scary sounds burst out from TV. The TV programme is
               showing The Ghost Radio.

               His fears has got worse. He clenched his fists on the remote
               and quickly changes the channel.
                             (TV retuning to other
                              channel)

               The TV still shows scary programmes from other channel
               despite him changing channels. He is really unconfortable,
               starts to get goosebumps, and is intensely scared, so he
               turns off the TV and threw the remote away.



               INT. LIVING ROOM FL.1

               The atmosphere around him starts to get weird. He rushes to
               the phone and immediately dial his parents.
                             (Earpiece slowly beeps)

               He anxiously looks around while waiting for his parents to
               receive a call. Meanwhile, water slowly dripping on the
               washing sink caught his attention. 

               The wind starts to blow through the window, creating eerie
               whistling noise, and the lights starts to flicker.

               He afraid that the ghost is pranking him and can't take it
               anymore. He hangs up the call, panics and flees upstairs into
               his bedroom.



               INT. BOY'S BEDROOM

               He hid under the blanket quickly but fully. The blanket
               covers him from head to toe. He closes his eye, trying to
               calm down and hoping everything will get better.

               After a while in the dark, he opens his eyes.
                             (The light shines through
                              the blanket.

               He faintly sees his blanket print. It is his favourite
               superhero.
                             (Heroic music plays)

               The boy seems to be more brave and more contained; although
               he is still in the blanket.

               He slowly emerge out from the blanket covering him
               thoroughly. He looks a bit suffocated as he hid for quite
               some time.

               After getting his head out, he sees clearer as the moon
               shines from the outside. That moonlight landed on the hero
               poster on the wall at the end of his bed.

               Then suddenly the phone in the living room downstairs rang. 

               He seems to hesitate at first, but his superhero inspired him
               to be courageous. He had made up his mind and get out of his
               bed to answer the ringing phone.



               INT. BOY'S BEDROOM
                             (Scene plays in heroic
                              slow-motion)

               The boy gets up, steps down from his bed. His feet touches
               the floor slowly but firmly.

               He sways his blanket over his shoulder. The blanket covers
               his back and perfectly make a really cool cape.

               He walks bravely towards the door. The moon shines behind
               him, creating glaring light rays while the light on top of
               him still flickers.



               INT. HALLWAY & STAIRS

               The door opened in a slow-motion. The boy walks out in a cool
               manner. His foot agitates the dust on the floor, creating a
               hazy ambience.

               Then he finally runs downstairs in slow motion.



               INT. WAY TO LIVING ROOM

               He walks right past the things he used to fear of, realising
               it was only his imagination and also found out that those
               creepy things was just a home decoration. 



               INT. LIVING ROOM FL.1

               The boy picked up the phone, saying something.
